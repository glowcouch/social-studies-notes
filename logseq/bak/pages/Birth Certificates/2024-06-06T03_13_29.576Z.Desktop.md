- ## Human rights violation (intro):
	- A lack of birth certificate is a major human rights violation. Specifically ((663ab18c-1cd0-41af-b5b2-f7864b69e41b)), because people without a legal identity aren't recognized properly by the law. Unfortunately, it's a very widespread issue; many children around the world don't officially exist. According to UNICEF 166 million children don't have a legal identity. This is a huge problem and, while there are many people working to solve it, is still incredibly prevalent.
- ## Consequences of not having a birth certificates:
	- Due to many government services requiring a legal identity — namely adequate healthcare, education, and social services — many people are deprived of numerous other legal identities. Additionally, people are much more susceptible to exploitation; unfortunately, if there is no proof of them existing it's extremely hard to keep track of them. Many children without birth certificates go missing and become child laborers and soldiers because, sadly, governments can't do much about nonexistent children going missing. Another huge consequence of unregistered births is that in many countries, the government underestimates the amount of people in a region. This results in unequally distributed resources, which — in turn — leads to more poverty and unregistered births.
