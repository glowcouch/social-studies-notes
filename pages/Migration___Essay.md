- The average New Zealand has a net fiscal contribution of $172, whereas migrants have a net fiscal contribution of $2653 [[@The New New Zealanders: Why migrants make good Kiwis]] . Furthermore in 2015 migrants contributed an estimated 9 percent (or USD 6.7 trillion) to global GDP - where in 2015 migrants made up 3% of the global population  . Therefore the common myth that migrants are a burden on the economy is provably false. While they do use public services and put strain on the health system, their contribution far outweighs their withdrawal.
