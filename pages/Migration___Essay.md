- Migration is a very controversial issue in politics, and is often exploited with "wedge politics" tactics. This has been incredibly evident in the 2024 U.S. election, where Donald Trump is pushing false information about migrants in an attempt to win voters over.
- Do migrants negatively affect their country of destination? According to The New Zealand Initiative, the average non-migrant has a net fiscal contribution of $172, whereas migrants have a net fiscal contribution of $2653 - 15 times more *(1)*. Furthermore, in 2015, migrants contributed an estimated 9 percent (or USD 6.7 trillion) to global GDP *(2)* - where in 2015 migrants made up 3% of the global population *(3)*. Therefore, the common myth that migrants are a burden on the economy is provably false. While they do use public services and put strain on the health system, their contribution far outweighs their withdrawal.
- Migrants do not "steal" jobs from non-migrants. This myth is propagated by politicians and media outlets, and is not based in reality. In fact - due to the strict immigration policies that are in place in most first world countries - migrants tend to fill gaps in the labour market. According to the MBIE (New Zealand's Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment), in 2019 the top 3 industries that had the most permanent migrants were health care and social assistance, information media and telecommunications, and professional scientific and technical services *(4)*. Which are all highly valued  professions: According to NZ Tech, the professional scientific and technical services industry has a shortage of, and growing demand for, highly skilled workers *(6) (7)*. People working in healthcare have high responsibilities, are very prone to stress and burnout, and simultaneously have low incentives. Consequently, the healthcare and social assistance industry is incredibly understaffed, not only in New Zealand *(5)*, but the entire world *(8)*. It's not an accident that most migrants work in high demand areas, New Zealand makes it easier for people with high-demand skills to migrate. For example, New Zealand has a fast track system for doctors wanting to immigrate *(9)*. This results in the large majority of migrants being highly trained, and highly valuable to the NZ economy.
- Terrorism is a large issue in a lot of countries, and very often migrants are used as the scapegoat. However - while some acts of terrorism are from migrants - most attacks are from citizens. America is a good case study of this because there is a lot of political controversy around migration policies and terrorism. According to New America, post 9/11, under half of deaths from terrorist attacks were jihadist (the most deaths being caused by ideologically far right attacks) *(10)*. While this might seem like a lot, jihadist terrorist groups - like ISIS - have realized that it is far easier to inspire people within the target country instead of sending operatives across the borders *(11)*. In fact according to the 2018 world migration report: "Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees are more likely to be the victims of violent extremism than the perpetrators of those acts" *(12)*. Additionally, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the largest category (about 35%) of domestic terrorism incidents between 2010 and 2021 were racially or ethnically motivated *(13)*. The prevalence of racially/ethnically motivated acts of violent extremism was very evident in the NZ Christchurch shootings, which was the result of white supremacist ideologies. During the attack the shooter killed 51 people and injured a further 40, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in NZ history *(14)*.
