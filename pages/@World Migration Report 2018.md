- [[Abstract]]
	- This report is the ninth in the world migration report series which is designed as a substantive contribution to increasing the understanding of current and strategic migration issues throughout the world. It presents key data and information on migration as well as thematic chapters on highly topical migration issues. It is structured to focus on two key contributions for readers: Part I: key information on migration and migrants (including migration-related statistics); and Part II: balanced, evidence-based analysis of complex and emerging migration issues. The two parts are intended to provide both overview information that helps to explain migration patterns and processes globally and regionally, as well as insights and recommendations on major issues that policymakers are - or soon - will be grappling with.
