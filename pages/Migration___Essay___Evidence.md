# Are migrants a burden to countries of destination?
	- ## Argument
		- No, in fact they are an overall benefit
	- ## Facts
		- It is estimated that nearly two-thirds of international migrants are migrant workers, contributing to the economies and societies where they live.
		- In 2015 alone, it is estimated that migrants contributed over 9 per cent (or USD 6.7 trillion) to global GDP. For example, it is estimated that between 1990 and 2014, migrants added GBP 175 billion and GBP 155 billion to the GDP of the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively.
		- Available data reveal that international remittances reached USD 702 billion in 2020 (up from USD 128 billion in 2000). Remittances to low- and middle-income countries already outstrip both ODA and FDI, significantly contributing to poverty alleviation and development.
- # Do migrant steal jobs from locals?
	- ## Argument
		- No, they fill gaps in the labor market
	- ## Facts
		- Although migrants are represented across all skill levels, many among them work in the so-called 3D jobs (dirty, dangerous, and demanding) such as in construction, domestic work, or hospitality. These jobs tend to be the least favored by the native-born. Many countries of destination rely on international migrants to address labor market shortages. The

- # Shouldnâ€™t we stop migrants to reduce the threat of terrorism?
	- ## Argument
		- No, most terrorists are from the country they are attacking
	- ## Facts
		- Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees are more likely to be the victims of violent extremism than the perpetrators of those acts. Violent extremism is a driver for internal displacement and migration.

		- The majority of recent terrorist attacks were committed by citizens of the country where they occurred. The overwhelming majority of terrorist attacks worldwide occur in developing and least developed countries, particularly those affected by conflict and violence.
