	- ## Argument
		- No, they fill gaps in the labor market
		- There is a labor shortage, so we actually need them
	- ## Facts
		- Although migrants are represented across all skill levels, many among them work in the so-called 3D jobs (dirty, dangerous, and demanding) such as in construction, domestic work, or hospitality. These jobs tend to be the least favored by the native-born. Many countries of destination rely on international migrants to address labor market shortages. The
		  COVID-19 pandemic has shed a light on the essential roles that migrant workers have long played in the functioning of society, including in critical sectors such as healthcare and the food industry.
		- Migrants provide a source of economic dynamism globally, and are overrepresented in innovation and patents, arts and sciences awards, start-ups, and successful companies.

	- ## Argument
		- No, most terrorists are from the country they are attacking
	- ## Facts
