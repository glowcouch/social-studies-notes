- Many people think that migrants are terrorists, and that the immigration routes should be restricted to decrease acts of violent extremism. However, this generally incorrect; in fact, migrants are actually much more likely to be the victims of terrorism. Furthermore, the majority of terrorist attacks are done by individuals who are citizens of the country being attacked. For example, the Christchurch shooting was a result of white supremacy, and occurred in a mosque. Terrorist groups - like ISIS for example - have realised that it is far easier to inspire people within the country than to send operatives over the border. This presumption most likely comes from the 9/11 attack, which was enacted by an Islamic terrorist group.
